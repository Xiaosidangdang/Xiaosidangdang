Hi Friends,

I'm working on a project need to extensively use growth curves and I found growth curver almost perfactly works for me. However, I noticed that the 
parameter of "lag time" is absent in the statistics data out. How can I incorperate this parameter into growth curver? To be specific, I'm starting with single cell in the inoculation.

Best,
Xiaosi
